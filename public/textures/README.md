# Textures Directory

This directory contains texture files for 3D model materials and colors.

## Directory Structure

- `materials/` - Material textures (metal finishes, surface treatments)
- `colors/` - Color textures and patterns

## Supported Formats

- `.jpg` - Good for photos and complex textures
- `.png` - Good for textures with transparency
- `.webp` - Modern format with better compression

## Usage

Textures are referenced in customization options and applied to 3D model materials.

## Optimization Tips

- Use appropriate resolutions (512x512, 1024x1024, or 2048x2048)
- Compress images for web use
- Use power-of-2 dimensions for better GPU performance
